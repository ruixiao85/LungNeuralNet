After training and validating (3:1) on 21 background image with 26 lymphocytes, 95 monocytes, and 22 polymorphonuclear leukocytes, the neural network is able to detect and categorize these cell types in a mouse lung bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (20X objective).

MRCNN, based on matterport's implementation, was incorporated and adapted to split/merge tiles from large image, simulate bronchoalveolar lavage from background & representative cell images, and batch-evaluate mean average precisions.

  
Within one day of training, the accuracy represented by mean average precision has reached 75% for all categories. The accuracy is highest for monocyte category.<br/>
